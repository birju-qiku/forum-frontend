The amazing symbiosis may have resulted in creation of a\nsmartphone experience of, as the title suggests, epic proportions. <o:p></o:p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Need a reason why Q Terra is the smartphone experience you\ndeserve (and need right now)? We’ll give you five, read on:<o:p></o:p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>A built-to-last\ndesign that should’ve been categorised under ‘contemporary art’<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Isn’t technology beautiful? No, we mean literally. Finely\ncut and polished to perfection, Terra’s lightweight body has a <b>matte finish</b> that feels effortless in\nyour hand, and looks superbly sleek to the people who’ll be staring at it in\nwondrous awe. And what good is beauty if it isn’t built to last? Q Terra is\nmade from <b>high-strength aerospace\naluminum alloy</b> that provides extra durability. It might even withstand a\nblast or something; though we don’t intend to test that. <o:p></o:p></p>\n\n<span wbb=\"wbbid_21\"><img src=\"http://blog.qiku.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12014983_1192272827465910_338176836943127773_o.png\"><span>﻿</span></span><br>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Supercomputer-esque\nperformance that just isn’t fair to the competition<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mobile apps are demanding, very demanding. We understand\nyour love for hurling multi-coloured birds at unsuspecting pigs, updating the\nworld via professionally captured selfies, and the constant need to do a\nmillion other tasks simultaneously. Q Terra’s <b>2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Octa-core processor</b> and <b>LPDDR4 4GB RAM</b> take care of those\nannoying hang-ups and heated moments that disrupt your experience. Multitasking\nshould be a smartphone’s top priority, and we haven’t forgotten that.<o:p></o:p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<span wbb=\"wbbid_23\"><img src=\"http://blog.qiku.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12017439_1191233140903212_7990080939404856477_o.png\"><span>﻿</span></span><br>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>2K display with more\npixels than we care to count<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Your eyes deserve to feast on the gorgeous <b>ultra-HD 2K screen</b> that Q Terra offers.\nWhether it’s an intense gaming session or your favorite action-thriller,\nTerra’s unparalleled visuals will take you right into the moment.

It was uploaded November 27th.&nbsp;<span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMtt-EyIfUg</span><br><br>It made me realize how great the phone may be. And i'm not talking about the 810 version, cause that one is just....i don't know, i'm not very confident about that chipset. And i don't think you can blame me for that. I mean - Oneplus 2, LG G Flex 2, HTC One M9 etc., all of them are known for heating issues.<br><br>On the other hand we have devices like LG G4 - an awesome phone; Moto X Style - again, amazing device; the latest addition of LG, the V10 - also very stable and good device. All of them running with Snapdragon 808. And all of the above mentioned phones are way more expensive than QiKU for example. So here, heats off to QiKU.<br><br>Now, concerning the screen. Everyone is raving about 2k, 4k screens. And I don't have anything against it, but in some case it's just pointless. It consumes battery and it doesn't feel any different than a 1080p screen. In the case of Sony Xperia Z5, i would see something special i guess. That screen is 4k only when you're browsing pictures or watching videos. Besides that it renders everything in 1080p, which is a smart move since it consumes battery. <br>But this phone costs like 50K, and again Snapdragon 810. Hmm...no thanks!<br><br>Now Q Terra has 6 inch screen, and would it have had a 2k or 4k screen, the battery consumption would be tremendous. Instead it has a 1080p screen coupled with a 3700mAh battery, which is huuuge....and on top of that, QiKU claims one of the strong point of 360 OS is battery life management. That is still to be tested, but if it's true....the battery life should be just awesome.&nbsp;<br><br>When they said they are about to enter India, most of the media was writing about a price of around 25K. Now, that they announced it at 20K, it just seems to me such a good choice, and not only for the mentioned reasons; also for the sleek design considering the huge battery, the 2.5D curved glass like we find on Motorola, Apple and other premium brands, the camera of course - which is a first for this industry.<br><br>I don't know....what do you guys think?<br><br><br>","posted_by":"SpaceInvader","posted_by_id":"563497730c66296110d0000e","category":"qterra","link":"Just-saw-this-review-on-Q-Terra","created_at":"2015-12-10T12:41:00.136Z","replyCount":10,"viewCount":88,"__v":0,"score":1.3565789473684209},{"_id":"565c8b58137f2415568edf37","title":"Waiting for the Qiku Q Terra 810 aka \"The Ultimate Game Changer\"","desc":"<span></span>I'll&nbsp;be&nbsp;patiently&nbsp;waiting&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Qiku&nbsp;to&nbsp;launch&nbsp;Qiku Q&nbsp;Terra&nbsp;810&nbsp;aka Q Terra&nbsp;Prime&nbsp;in India.&nbsp;<br><br>","posted_by":"Abhi007","posted_by_id":"565c89d4137f2415568edf34","category":"qterra","link":"Waiting-for-the-Qiku-Q-Terra--aka-The-Ultimate-Game-Changer","created_at":"2015-11-30T17:46:00.492Z","replyCount":2,"viewCount":36,"__v":0,"score":1.3524305555555556},{"_id":"5666a3d5d8a63a7d66bc9f61","title":"Q terra","desc":"Invite me to buy a Q terra<br>","posted_by":"rdjha","posted_by_id":"5666a281d8a63a7d66bc9f5d","category":"qterra","link":"Q-terra","created_at":"2015-12-08T09:33:09.405Z","replyCount":1,"viewCount":12,"__v":0,"score":1.35},{"_id":"56657484d8a63a7d66bc9b1d","title":"Greetings Terrans!
